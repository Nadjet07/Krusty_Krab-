The Golden Slice – Vegetarian Pizza Recipe
Ingredients (for 1 medium pizza):
• 1 ball of pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)
• 4 tablespoons of high-quality tomato sauce (e.g. San Marzano)
• 150g fresh mozzarella (add a pinch of turmeric for a golden hue, if desired)
• 30g grated parmesan cheese
• ½ yellow zucchini, sliced thinly (for a golden, elegant look)
• A handful of fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced
• A few sun-dried tomato petals (optional, for extra color and flavor)
• A few fresh basil leaves
• 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil
• Pinch of sea salt
• Optional: Garlic-infused olive oil
• Optional: edible gold flakes or gold food-grade glitter for decoration
Preparation Steps:
1. Preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F). Place a pizza stone inside if you have one.
2. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and place it on parchment paper.
3. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the base, leaving a border.
4. Tear the mozzarella into pieces and distribute it over the sauce.
5. Top with the yellow zucchini slices, mushrooms, and a few sun-dried tomato petals.
6. Sprinkle grated parmesan over the top, and add a pinch of turmeric for a warm golden tone (optional).
7. Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.
8. Remove from oven, garnish with basil leaves and drizzle with olive oil (plus truffle oil if using).
9. Finish with a touch of edible gold flakes for visual impact and flair.
